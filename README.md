# artificial intelligence research papers.

The repository serves as both a personal research log and a knowledge-sharing hub, covering topics across machine learning, deep learning, representation learning, large language models, and AI systems.

Each entry or notebook captures the core ideas, mathematical intuitions, experimental takeaways, and practical applications from the papers studied â€” transforming complex research into a clear, actionable understanding.

The goal is to bridge theory and practice by documenting how research concepts can be reproduced, extended, or applied in real-world machine learning systems.
